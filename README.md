# Notepad - another one Text Editor

Now, hard to surprise anybody another one text editor, but Notepad can to surprise you!

Let's start with the usual advantages:

Very VERY FAST, compare:

1. [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3): 0.912s - 1st (on Python)    

2. [Atom](https://atom.io/): 4.752s 2nd (on Electron - HTML, CSS(LESS), JavaScript)
     
3. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?wt.mc_id=DX_841432): 8.800s - 3rd (on Electron - HTML, CSS, JavaScript)                  

Of course, it was Very difficult to overtake Sublime Text 3 or at least Atom (My love is Atom)

But, i did it:

1. Notepad - 0.524s - 1st (on Electron - HTML, CSS(LESS), JavaScript)

2. [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3): 0.912s - 2nd (on Python)    

3. [Atom](https://atom.io/): 4.752s 3rd (on Electron - HTML, CSS(LESS), JavaScript)
